		<td Class = "blog">
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Border</strong>:   outliner of the pattern</li>
		<li><strong>Margin</strong>:   Margins are the spaces outside the border, between the border and the other elements next to this object. </li>
		<li><strong>Padding</strong>:  Padding is the space inside the border between the border and the actual image or cell contents.</li>

	<td><span Class="Question">What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</span></td>
	<td Class = "blog">
	<ul>
		<li><strong>id</strong>:    Unique element should use ID as place for styling.</li>
		<li><strong>Class</strong>:   More than one element should use class as place for styling.</li>
		</ul>
	</td>

	<tr>
	<td><span Class="Question">What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</span></td>
	<td Class = "blog">
	<ul>
		<li><strong>relative</strong>:    If you specify position:relative, then you can use top or bottom, and left or right to move the element relative to where it would normally occur in the document.</li>
		<li><strong>absolute</strong>:  When you specify position:absolute, the element is removed from the document and placed exactly where you tell it to go.</li>
		<li><strong>fixed</strong>:   A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself.</li>
		</ul>
	</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><span Class="Question">What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</span></td>
	<td Class = "blog">
	<ul>
		<li><strong>inline</strong>:  An inline element has no line break before or after it, and it tolerates HTML elements next to it.</li>
		<li><strong>inline block</strong>:  An inline-block element is placed as an inline element (on the same line as adjacent content), but it behaves as a block element.</li>
		</ul>
